5. Wait for the download to finish (it's about 25 MB)

### Step 1.2: Install Python

1. Find the downloaded file (probably in your Downloads folder)
   - It's named something like: `python-3.11.9-amd64.exe`

2. **Double-click** the file to start installation

   Before clicking anything, look at the bottom of the window

   You'll see two checkboxes:

   **You MUST check both boxes!** ‚úÖ‚úÖ

4. Now click the big button that says **"Install Now"**

   ```
5. Press **Enter**
6. You should see something like: `Python 3.11.9`
   - If you see this, SUCCESS! Move to Part 2.

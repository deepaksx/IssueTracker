- **CSRF Protection**: Form submissions are protected
- **Immutable Audit Logs**: Audit logs cannot be edited or deleted
- **Session Timeout**: Configurable session expiration

## User Management

You can manage users in two ways:

### 1. Web Interface (Recommended)

Admin users can manage users through the web interface:
1. Log in as an admin user
2. Click "Users" in the navigation menu
3. Add, edit, or delete users with a user-friendly interface

Features:
- Create new users with username, password, and role
- Edit existing users (change username, password, or role)
- Delete users (cannot delete your own account)
- View all users in a table

### 2. Command-Line Interface

For quick user management without starting the web server, use the CLI tool:

```bash
manage_users.bat
```

Or directly:
```bash
python manage_users_cli.py
```

The CLI tool provides:
- List all users
- Create new users
- Delete users
- Change user passwords
- Change user roles

### 3. Programmatically

You can also add users programmatically by modifying `init_db.py`:

```python
from models import User

# Create a new user
User.create(username='newuser', password='securepassword', role='viewer')
```

Then run:
```bash
python init_db.py
```

## Customization

### Changing the Secret Key

Edit `app.py` and change this line:
```python
app.secret_key = 'your-secret-key-change-in-production'
```

Use a strong, random secret key in production!

### Changing the Port

Edit `app.py` and modify the last line:
```python
app.run(debug=True, host='127.0.0.1', port=5000)  # Change port here
```

### Database Location

By default, the SQLite database is created in the project root. To change the location, edit the `db_path` parameter in `models.py`.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Alt+D**: Go to Dashboard
- **Alt+N**: Add New Issue (admin only)
- **Alt+A**: View Audit Log
- **ESC**: Close modals

## Troubleshooting

### Database Issues

If you encounter database errors, try reinitializing:
```bash
# Delete the existing database
rm issue_tracker.db  # On Windows: del issue_tracker.db

# Reinitialize
python init_db.py
```

### Port Already in Use

If port 5000 is already in use, either:
1. Stop the application using that port
2. Change the port in `app.py` (see Customization section)

### Module Not Found Errors

Make sure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

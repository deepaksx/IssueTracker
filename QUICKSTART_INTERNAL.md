## Troubleshooting

### Cannot access from other computers

1. **Check service is running:**
   ```powershell
   nssm status EFIIssueTracker
   ```

2. **Check firewall:**
   ```powershell
   netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name="EFI Issue Tracker"
   ```

   If not found:
   ```powershell
   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="EFI Issue Tracker" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=8000
   ```

3. **Verify port is listening:**
   ```powershell
   netstat -an | findstr :8000
   ```
   Should show: `0.0.0.0:8000  LISTENING`

4. **Test from client:**
   ```powershell
   Test-NetConnection -ComputerName [SERVER-IP] -Port 8000
   ```

### Service won't start

1. **Check if port is in use:**
   ```powershell
   netstat -ano | findstr :8000
   ```

2. **Restart service:**
   ```powershell
   nssm restart EFIIssueTracker
   ```

3. **Check error logs:**
   ```powershell
   type C:\IssueTracker\logs\service_error.log
   ```

### Users can't login

1. **Verify account exists:**
   ```powershell
   python manage_users_cli.py
   # Choose option 1 to list all users
   ```

2. **Reset password:**
   ```powershell
   python manage_users_cli.py
   # Choose option 4 to change password
   ```
